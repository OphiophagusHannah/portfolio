                <h3>my dev journey</h3>
                    <p>I started my development journey in 2015 as a part of my user experience studies to execute my ideas and prototype them more effectively. With time I gained more interest in development. My development expertise is mostly focused on frontend development, however, I have a big interest in computer graphic programing and data visualization. I have been working as Frontend Engineer for 5+ years and my interactive design knowledge have been positively affecting my dev work. In parallel with my main work, I have been exploring new development and design technologies through my personal studies and projects. I am always curious and interested to learn more and take new challenges</p>
